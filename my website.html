<h2 id="painting">Painting</h2>
<img src="Painting.jpg" alt="Night" width="233" height="268" align="top">
<p>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support").
The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.
In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a painting"). The support for 
paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may 
incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects. Painting is an important 
form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture (as in gestural painting), narration (as in narrative art), 
and abstraction (as in abstract art). Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic,
abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature.</p>
<h2 id="pottery">Pottery</h2>
<img src="Pottery.jpg" alt="Mugs" width="261" height="363" align="top">
<p>Pottery is the process and the products of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other ceramic materials, 
which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard, durable form. Major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. 
The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery (plural "potteries"). The definition of pottery used by 
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), is "all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, 
structural, and refractory products."In archaeology, especially of ancient and prehistoric periods, "pottery" often means vessels only, 
and figures of the same material are called "terracottas." Clay as a part of the materials used is required by some definitions of pottery, 
but this is dubious.</p>
<h2 id="sketch">Sketch</h2>
<img src="Sketch.jpg" alt="Road scene" width="225" height="300" align="top">
<p>A sketch (ultimately from Greek σχέδιος – schedios, "done extempore" is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that 
is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that 
the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically 
demonstrating an image, idea or principle. Sketches can be made in any drawing medium. The term is most often applied 
to graphic work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. It may also apply 
to drawings executed in pen and ink, digital input such as a digital pen, ballpoint pen, marker pen, water colour and 
oil paint. The latter two are generally referred to as "water colour sketches" and "oil sketches". A sculptor might model 
three-dimensional sketches in clay, plasticine or wax.</p>
<h2 id="designing">Designing</h2>
<img src="Dress.jpg" alt="Dress" width="270" height="440" align="top">
<p>A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an 
activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process. 
The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object 
without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered
to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, 
functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment. Major 
examples of designs include architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns.</p>
